        <p>We receive countless inquiries from parties who &ldquo;just want a blog like <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com">It&rsquo;s Nice That</a>&rdquo; without them fully understanding the nature of what is actually involved in the continuous curation of digital content. We asked writer <a href="http://twitter.com/sarah_chapman">Sarah Chapman</a> to visit the It&rsquo;s Nice That studio to meet some of the unsung heroes who, collectively, we believe are the secret to the success. </p>
      </div>

    <h1>It&rsquo;s Nice That: what is it?</h1>
    <div class="col col_780 padd_240 first">
      <div class="img"><img src="/images/dec/int-smile.png" alt="It's Nice That smiley logo"></div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about any of us, here [in the studio]. It&rsquo;s about everyone around us; everyone that we cover.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Will Hudson smiles. &ldquo;Never call it &lsquo;a blog&rsquo; in our presence,&rdquo; he says.</p> 
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like a website.&rdquo; adds Alex Bec, tongue partly in cheek. &ldquo;Not just a blog.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Will and Alex are the directors of It&rsquo;s Nice That <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. Though best known for their, uh, <em>website</em>, the It&rsquo;s Nice That stable also publishes a quarterly magazine and organises events. The duo also run a creative agency called New Studio London <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>.</p> 
      <p>Founded by Will in 2007, Alex joined It&rsquo;s Nice That soon after, in 2008. Since then, as the business has grown, so too has the team.</p> 
      <p>I am joined, around a large table at It&rsquo;s Nice That&rsquo;s east London office, by online editor Rob Alderson, magazine editor Alex Moshakis and events project leader Maya Davies. Others sit nearby, tapping away at their computers.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;When you start to have a bit of success, you have to make a call about whether it&rsquo;s a hobby or it&rsquo;s a business,&rdquo; Alex Bec says honestly, in relation to It&rsquo;s Nice That&rsquo;s beginnings and subsequent evolution. &ldquo;It could just be me and Will. It wouldn&rsquo;t be better, but life would be simpler. There has been a conscious decision: we want this to be something bigger that just the two of us.&rdquo;</p>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="/images/dec/int/screenshot-1.png" alt="Screenshot of INT site">
        <div class="caption">
          <p>The It&rsquo;s Nice That homepage circa 2011 where curated content has been king since 2007.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>It is bigger. Much bigger. The mission of It&rsquo;s Nice That is to champion creativity or, as Maya puts it: &ldquo;good things; good projects; good people.&rdquo; In that sense, then, the nebulous nature of the network of contacts and collaborators, and indeed those who have been covered by It&rsquo;s Nice That, makes them a force to be reckoned with.</p> 
      <p>Alex Bec is unassumingly modest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about any of us, here [in the studio],&rdquo; he insists. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about everyone around us; everyone that we cover. It happens to be us, sort of, manning it logistically.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>To suggest that It&rsquo;s Nice That merely handles logistics is something of a humble understatement. Propositions that appear to be simple are often powered by something altogether more significant or sophisticated. The challenge is making it seem so easy; like the metaphorical swan paddling furiously beneath the water.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;You have to be nimble. In five years, we&rsquo;ll be working on something that we definitely haven’t thought of yet.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Online editor Rob is no stranger to this phenomenon. &ldquo;Things, outwardly, might seem straight forward, but when you break it down, it&rsquo;s complicated. We update the website between three and nine times each day, 51 weeks each year,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like other websites and blogs where there are no posts for two weeks because someone&rsquo;s on holiday. [Will and Alex] have invested in staff.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It becomes obvious that the continued success of It&rsquo;s Nice That is inextricably linked to the recruitment of brilliant people. Not only have Will and Alex spent their hard-earned on these individuals, they have invested their trust in them.</p>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="/images/dec/int/screenshot-2.png" alt="Screenshot of INT site">
        <div class="caption">
          <p>Appearance can be deceptive: Behind the now classic chronological scream of articles comprises of 4,806 written, edited, curated and published posts.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>&ldquo;When new people join,&rdquo; explains Will, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about them being on the track we&rsquo;re already on. It&rsquo;s more about asking them where they want to take It&rsquo;s Nice That.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Rob, who joined last July, sees it as creative freedom. &ldquo;Everyone who comes on board buys into what we do here at some level,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but within that, you&rsquo;re also given the space to explore and experiment.&rdquo;</p> 
      <p>We arrive, following more musing, at the notion of responsibility. Will and Alex feel they owe it to their staff to allow them to shape the future of the business, but it&rsquo;s also apparent that the whole team feels a wider responsibility to their audience.</p> 
      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t post everything,&rdquo; says Will. &ldquo;If we were to do that, then the reliance on our curatorial skills is gone. People wouldn&rsquo;t believe in us any more. If the belief is gone, that&rsquo;s us gone too.&rdquo;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;We update the website between three and nine times each day, 51 weeks each year. It&rsquo;s not like other websites and blogs where there are no posts for two weeks because someone’s on holiday.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This sense of responsibility to the audience is also manifested in It&rsquo;s Nice That&rsquo;s approach to communicating change. Having introduced paid-for content and, most recently, advertising to the magazine, the team feels it&rsquo;s their duty to explain these decisions to their readers.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Apart from being explicit and actually saying it has happened,&rdquo; says Alex Moshakis about the advertising, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re explaining that the reason we have done it is to improve the magazine. It&rsquo;s so that we can cover more stuff, and cover it in better ways.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The same is true across the business. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just take massive dividends,&rdquo; says Alex Bec. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re investing it back in.&rdquo;</p>
      <div class="img">
        <img src="/images/dec/int/screenshot-3.png" alt="Screenshot of INT site">
        <div class="caption">
          <p>The &lsquo;What&rsquo;s On&rsquo; section is just one of the additional content streams that It&rsquo;s Nice That have added over the years in response to needs and opportunities they&rsquo;ve identified along the way. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Progress is fast, too. &ldquo;There is a real can-do attitude and because there is such a range of skills, we can accomplish a lot internally,&rdquo; says Maya. &ldquo;Things happen really quickly.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>With ambitions to add more individuals to the studio, Alex Bec speculates on what&rsquo;s next for It&rsquo;s Nice That. &ldquo;You have to be nimble,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In five years, we&rsquo;ll be working on something that we definitely haven&rsquo;t thought of yet.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>That, he ponders, could be the reason why he and the others get out of bed in the mornings: the excitement and challenge of the unknown. &ldquo;The people in this space, and the people around us, they&rsquo;ll be deciding what happens in the future,&rdquo; he says.</p> 
      <p>At present, It&rsquo;s Nice That is a website, a magazine and events. More importantly, though, it is seven diligent people who are dedicating their lives to sharing everything that is excellent in the creative industries. In doing so, they&rsquo;re rightly putting second year students on the same stage as established ad agencies.</p> 
      <p>&ldquo;We describe It&rsquo;s Nice That as <em>meritocratic</em>,&rdquo; <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a> says Will, pronouncing each syllable carefully. &ldquo;Is that actually a real word?&rdquo;</p>
