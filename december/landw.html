          <div class="copy">
            <p>PayPal collects money from banks and processes the payment into your account held at PayPal. A secure request is made to check for funds, PayPal will either draw this from the users PayPal account or go directly to the bank and check for funds. If a green light is given, the transaction is honoured and your customer will get a thanks and a receipt. If a red light is given the transaction fails and no sale is made.</p>

              <p>Shopify has an API<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> that allows you to make applications that talk directly to your Shopify database.

            <p>One of the tricky areas to manage is what to do when you have sold an item, otherwise known as fulfilment. A medium sized business will need to look at how they manage picking tickets, storage for their stock, printing invoices, areas for packaging, who is coming to collect the post and at what time. Calculating P&amp;P can be a bit of a dark art<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>, the weight and size of a product can really help with UK shipping &ndash; you should look to be as accurate as possible here. International shipping is the really tricky one, if possible work closely with your logistics company to ensure the price you charge the customer is enough. This is a constantly evolving beast for those who grow their online sales. Some even choose to outsource this all to third parties such as Amazon.</p>

        <h3>Other Important Notes</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="copy">
            <p>As consumers we often don&rsquo;t think much of getting a refund from a retailer, these transactions are called &lsquo;chargebacks&rsquo; by the card companies and are monitored very closely. A chargeback is any transaction going from the retailer back to the customer, so this covers fraud, refunds, disputes and more. Retailers must have a very low rate of chargebacks, in some cases this is less than 1% of their annual turn over before they incur fines and charges from their merchant. We urge you to fully research the contracts of the companies you choose to work with. </p>
          </div>

      </div>
      <div class="footnotes">
        <p id="footnote-1">1. The most suitable online payment gateway may not actually be from your existing merchant. Some merchants offer an all-in-one service that includes a payment gateway and an IMA, however from speaking to online retailers the charges and costs involved are always worth fully investigating first.</p>
        <p id="footnote-2">2. SKU is a acronym for stock keeping unit, it is a unique code that represents a product or service sold. Really handy when you have long products names with lots of variations such as colour and size.</p>
        <p id="footnote-3">3. API is a acronym for application programming interface, this is a specification that allows two pieces of software to communicate one another. </p>
        <p id="footnote-4">4. There is no hard and fast rule of shipping other than to get all the weight and size data you can about an item and align this with the packaging and labour required to put this all together. You will need to calculate savings for multiple goods too. Putting practice combinations through your shop to see how your savings are being applied is the best way to test the rules you have created.</p>
